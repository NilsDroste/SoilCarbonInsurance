Droste, N., May, W., Clough, Y., BÃ¶rjesson, G., Brady, M.V., Hedlund, K. (2020). Soil Carbon insures arable crop production against increasing adverse weather due to climate change. *Environmental Research Letters*. Forthcoming: doi: [10.1088/1748-9326/abc5e3](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abc5e3)


## Data origin

The yield and soil data belongs to the [Swedish Long-Term experiments](https://www.slu.se/en/faculties/nj/this-is-the-nj-faculty/collaborative-centres-and-major-research-platforms/long-term-field-experiments-/plant-nutrition-and-soil-fertility/) on Soil Fertility (R3-9001) by the Swedish University for Agricultural Sciences.
